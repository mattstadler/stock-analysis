# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to automate the analysis of various stocks. Specifically, it take produces total volume and return in a given year for a group of stocks. 

## Results

The data show that while a majority of stocks in the set analyzed produced positive returns in 2017, most showed negative returns in 2018. There does not appear to be a similar pattern in total volume.

## Summary

The refactored code sped up the time of execution significantly. While the difference was negligible when analyzing a group of one dozen stocks, it may become more significant when working with hundreds or thousands of stocks. Furthermore, it could allow for more efficient analysis of various metrics.

The refactored code did take longer to create, and may not be worth writing for smaller analyses which could be done as efficiently manually. At scale, refactoring suggests real advantages.
